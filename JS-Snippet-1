console.log(1 + [0]); // Output: "10"
Why? Step by step:
We have 1 + [0].

The + operator in JavaScript can mean numeric addition or string concatenation.

If either operand is a string, JS will convert the other to a string and concatenate.

[0] is an array with a single element.

When used in a string/primitive context, arrays are converted with .toString().

[0].toString() → "0".

Now the expression becomes:

js
Copy code
1 + "0"
Since one operand is a string, JS coerces the other (1) into a string too.

"1" + "0" → "10"
