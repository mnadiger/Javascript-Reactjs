console.log(1 + + "2" + "2");

Output: 32

why?

ðŸ§© Step 1: Identify the expression

    1 + + "2" + "2"


  Here we have:

    -  a number 1
    -  a unary plus (+) before "2"
    -  and another "2" (a string)

ðŸ§  Step 2: Understand the unary plus

  The unary plus (+) operator tries to convert its operand to a number.

  +"2"  // converts the string "2" â†’ number 2


So now the expression becomes:

1 + 2 + "2"


ðŸ”¢ Step 3: Evaluate left-to-right

  JavaScript evaluates from left to right.

  (a) First: 1 + 2

    Both are numbers â†’ numeric addition
    â†’ 3
  
    Now we have:

    3 + "2"

  (b) Second: 3 + "2"

    Now one operand is a string, and one is a number.


ðŸ‘‰ In JavaScript, when one operand is a string, the other is converted to a string, and concatenation happens.

So:

3 + "2"  â†’  "3" + "2" â†’ "32"
