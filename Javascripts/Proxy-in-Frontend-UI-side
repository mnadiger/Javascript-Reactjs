In frontend development, a proxy usually means:

‚û°Ô∏è A middle layer between your frontend app (like React/Angular/Vue) and the backend server.
‚û°Ô∏è Its main job is to forward API requests from the UI to the backend.



Why do we need it?
    
    To avoid CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues.
    
    To hide backend server details from the browser.
    
    To route requests easily during local development.



Example (React Dev Proxy ‚Äì package.json)

    {
      "name": "frontend-app",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
    }



‚úÖ If frontend runs on http://localhost:3000 and backend on http://localhost:5000:

  A call to fetch('/api/users') from the React app automatically gets proxied to http://localhost:5000/api/users.
  
  Browser thinks request goes to same origin (3000), so no CORS problem.

üëâ In frontend, proxy is about redirecting API calls transparently.
